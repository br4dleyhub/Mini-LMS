## Finding 1 – Cleartext Communication (HTTP)

### Description
The application communicates over HTTP, meaning credentials and sensitive data are transmitted without encryption.

### Impact
An attacker on the same network could intercept usernames and passwords, leading to account compromise.

### Risk
High

### Evidence
Application accessible over http://127.0.0.1:5000 without TLS.

### Recommendation
Enforce HTTPS and disable plain HTTP in production environments.

## Finding 2 – Missing Rate Limiting on Authentication

### Description
The login endpoint allows unlimited authentication attempts without delay or lockout.

### Impact
An attacker can perform brute-force attacks to guess passwords.

### Risk
Medium to High

### Evidence
Repeated failed login attempts are accepted without restriction.

### Recommendation
Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed attempts.

---

## Finding 3 – Missing Session Management

### Description
Successful authentication does not establish a session or authentication state.

### Impact
Users are not persistently authenticated, and access control cannot be enforced.

### Risk
Medium

### Recommendation
Implement secure sessions or token-based authentication.

---

## Finding 4 – Missing CSRF Protection

### Description
Form-based requests do not include CSRF tokens.

### Impact
Authenticated users could be tricked into performing unintended actions.

### Risk
Medium

### Recommendation
Implement CSRF protection for all state-changing requests.
