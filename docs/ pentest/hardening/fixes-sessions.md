## Fix – Session Management

### Issue Addressed
Authentication did not create a persistent session, preventing access control.

### Solution
Implemented Flask session-based authentication with secure cookie settings.

### Result
- Users maintain authenticated state
- Protected routes enforce authorization
- Logout properly clears session
