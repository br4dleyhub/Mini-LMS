## Fix – Rate Limiting on Authentication

### Issue Addressed
Missing rate limiting allowed unlimited login attempts, enabling brute-force attacks.

### Solution
Implemented server-side rate limiting based on failed login attempts per username.

### Result
- Brute-force attempts are blocked
- Login attempts are logged
- Risk reduced significantly
