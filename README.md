# Personal Secure Learning Management System (Mini-LMS)

## Overview

This project is a personal learning project designed to progressively build a simple Learning Management System (LMS) while learning core concepts in programming, networking, cybersecurity, and ethics.

The system is developed step by step, starting from a command-line application and evolving into a secure web-based system with a backend and frontend.

This project is intended for educational purposes.

## Security and Ethics Notice

This project intentionally starts with insecure implementations in early phases to demonstrate common security mistakes and their risks.

Security improvements are introduced progressively to promote understanding and responsible development.

---

## How to Run

Instructions will be added in later phases once the application is implemented.

## Phase 2 – Python CLI Application

### Description

In this phase, a command-line based Mini-LMS application was implemented using Python. The goal was to practice core programming concepts and basic backend logic before introducing security or networking complexity.

The application allows users to register, log in, and view a basic profile through a terminal interface.

---

### Features Implemented

- Command-line menu system
- User registration
- User login authentication
- Persistent storage using a JSON file
- Basic user session handling

---

### Project Structure (Phase 2)

├── app.py

├── users.json

└── README.md

### Screenshots

Screenshots will be added to demonstrate:
- main menu
- user registration
- login process
- profile viewing

---

### Known Limitations

- Passwords are stored in plain text
- No input validation
- No protection against brute-force login attempts
- No concurrent user handling

These limitations are intentional and will be addressed in later phases.
